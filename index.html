            <p>New release Candy Dulfer</p>
            <p>Dutch saxophonist CANDY DULFER continues to push boundaries with the release of her new album 'Together'. 
                The album was inspired by all that’s great in jazz, disco, soul, dance and r&b, but is also a contemporary 
                interpretation of what’s happening in music and the world today. Candy created a deeply personal and unique 
                blend of musical genres & influences, bound together by her trademark sound, showcasing her extreme versatility.
